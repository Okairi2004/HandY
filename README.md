Developed a Python-based gesture recognition system to translate live webcam video into real-time system
controls.
Used OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to enable gesture-based control of mouse (cursor, click) and
keyboard (playback, volume) functions.
Engineered gesture logic using Euclidean distance (”pinch-to-click”) and joint-angle analysis (”open-palm play”)
for reliable command mapping.
